The AWS resources needed to run these labs include:

1. An Amazon Redshift Serverless endpoint in a new networking environment that includes a VPC, 3 Subnets, an Internet Gateway, and a Security Group to enable local access to your cluster.
2. An Amazon Redshift Provisioned cluster in the same networking environment for use in the data sharing lab.
3. An Amazon EC2 instance containing some tools needed for this lab for the migration and Power BI lab.
4. A default role attached to your environments.
